As there were almost 500-600 images used the entire data cannot be uploaded. These can be downloaded from here or one can create there own dataset and proceed. 
Also the train.record files weren't getting uploaded as there were a lot of images.
This project's entire description can be found at the link above. Feel free to contact me at devika.mishra@dataturks.com for any other details.
